## Intro

A11y static analysis tools [can only get you so far](https://karlgroves.com/web-accessibility-testing-what-can-be-tested-and-how/) and don't assure on the quality of the user experience for screen reader users. This means teams need to perform lots of manual tests with multiple screen readers to ensure great UX which can take a lot of time... **not anymore!**

With [Guidepup](https://www.guidepup.dev/) you can automate your screen reader test workflows the same you as would for mouse or keyboard based scenarios, no sweat!

## Quick Features

- **Full Control** - if a screen reader has a keyboard command, then Guidepup supports it.
- **Mirrors Real User Experience** - assert on what your users really do, see, and hear when using screen readers.
- **Framework Agnostic** - run with Jest, with Playwright, as an independent script, no vendor lock-in.

## Get Started

Setup your environment for screen reader automation with [`@guidepup/setup`](https://github.com/guidepup/setup):

```console
npx @guidepup/setup
```

Install Guidepup to your project:

```console
npm install @guidepup/guidepup
```

And get cracking with your first screen reader automation code!

```ts
import { voiceOver } from "@guidepup/guidepup";

async function run(): Promise<void> {
  // Start your screen reader instance
  await voiceOver.start();

  // Navigate your environment with screen readers just as your users do
  await voiceOver.next();

  // Assert on what your users really see and hear when using screen readers
  console.log(await voiceOver.lastSpokenPhrase());

  await voiceOver.stop();
}

run();
```
